Class - Multiple Inheritance :- 
----------------------------

Benefit of Multiple Inheritance is sometimes you have two different classes and you want to inherite 
METHODS and PROPERTIES of both classes.  -- To reuse code.

Child class can access Methods of class Father and class Mother.

Child class Inherate properties of Father and Mather so child has access of cooking and gardening.

Child is Derived class 

Father and Mother is Base Class for Child class.

***************

class Father():
   def gardening(self):
       print("I Love gardening")

class Mother():
   def cooking(self):
       print("I Love cooking")

class Child(Father,Mother):
    def sports(self):
        print("I Love sports")

>>> c.gardening()		----class Object
I Love gardening

>>> c.cooking()
I Love cooking

>>> c.sports()
I Love sports

*****************************
In a single method you can call base class method.

Name of the methods are same.

class Father():
   def skills(self):
       print("gardening,programming")

class Mother():
   def skills(self):
       print("cooking,art")

class Child(Father,Mother):
    def skills(self):
        Father.skills(self)
        Mother.skills(self)
        print("sports")

c = Child()
c.skills()

ardening,programming
cooking,art
sports
